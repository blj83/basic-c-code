compile: use the command make or gcc -o dummyshell dummyshell.c

run: make run or ./dummyshell
once in the dummyshell enter a command into the line and it will execute it.
To run programs you must input ./programName parameters for it to run
for example ./buzz 10 999999 2 will run the program BuzzOff.c.
If you type the & after the commands entered it will run the program in the
background ex ./buzz 10 9999992 &.

To exit the shell type the work "exit"
